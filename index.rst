The Neuromorphic Computing Platform allows non-expert neuroscientists and engineers to perform experiments with configurable neuromorphic computing systems.
The platform provides two complementary, large-scale neuromorphic systems built in custom hardware at locations in Heidelberg, Germany (the "physical model" or PM system) and Manchester, United Kingdom (the "many core" or MC system). Both systems enable energy-efficient, large-scale neuronal network simulations with simplified spiking neuron models. The PM system is based on physical (analogue) emulations of neuron models and offers highly accelerated operation (10\ :superscript:`4` x real time). The MC system is based on a digital many-core architecture and provides real-time operation.
